Description of the project:
Here you can find a simple algorithm that allows lego-robot to follow the wall, this algorithm used PID calculations.
PL used: python


Description of the work process:
need to semble lego-robot with UltraSonicSensor
find proper Kp, Ki, Kd - you can do it experimentally (keeping in mind theory behind that)


Explanation of the result values:
My lego-robot goes along the wall for a sinusoidal trajectory, because of PID coefficients.

Explanation why do you think this values are the best:
I needed to implement Motion along the wall - I did it :) No one say how it expected to be, so when I get satisfied result, I stopped on it. 
The robot do it smoothly.
